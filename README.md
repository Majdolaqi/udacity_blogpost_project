# Udacity DataScientist Nanodegree's Blogpost Project
This is a data-science project, in its very initial stage, that attempts to learn and understand various statistics from the [StackOverflow annual developer survey dataset](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

## Requirements
Python version 3.x.

Jupyter (Any recent, stable version)

You will need to download the raw datafiles of the survey from the link above.

The naming convention of the survey files is 'stack_overflow_{year_name}.csv'. This should be placed in the root directory of the project. You run the first cell in the notebook to check if this works.

## Motivation
The project, in its current state, mainly aims to derive various insights around the salary of a software developer.

You can read more about the statistics and conclusions derived by this project by following the blog post.

There were various challenges to the implementation of the project. Most of them have been captured in the notebook.

## I solemly swear.. (Disclaimer)
The project is in a state of prototype. There is a need of serious refactoring. 

Also, the entire project is in a single jupyter notebook. This is just for demonstration purpose.

You will find a lot of code duplicated. Again, this is just for the purpose of illustration.
