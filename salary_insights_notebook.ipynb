    "2. Years 2015 and 2016 have provided salary range and salary midpoint. So, it is easier to consider salary midpoint as an average salary mark.\n",
    "3. Years 2011-2014 have provided salary range in the salary field. In order to maintain consistency, we need to convert the range to salary midpoint.\n",
    "4. All the nan values in salary are dropped.\n",
    "5. Values like 'Student / Unemployed', 'Rather not say' are also dropped.\n",
    "6. 2018 already has column names called 'Salary'. But, since we are considering only converted salary, we need to drop the actual 'Salary' column, before renaming."
